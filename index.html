                        It’s perhaps impossible to forget a man who’s career and life captivated the likes of a whole culture the way Vincente Fernandez did. An artist, actor, producer, and public figure, “El Rey de la Musica Ranchera'' touched the lives of so many fans in Latin America and abroad throughout his entire career. From humble beginnings to a life of stardom, it wasn’t hard to see why a whole nation deemed him an idol and why his songs were instant classics that, still to this day, are heard across the continent. This is the life of Fernandez, and a tribute to his determination and passion that he always implemented into his work, which helped define the Regional Mexican music genre for generations to come.

                    <p class="body-text">Vicente Fernandez Gomez was born on February 17th, 1940 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. He grew up in a low-income family which struggled to support themselves on their ranch in the village of Huentitan El Alto, Jalisco, eventually leading them to move to Tijuana. Growing up, Fernandez developed a passion for music and signing as he watched artists like Pedro Infante and Jorge Negrete on the big screen. At the age of 8 he received his first guitar and began studying music, further developing his passion for it. In his teenage years, he began to work in several occupations and yet wherever he went, he would sing and perform to those around him. However, it was at the age of 14 in which he began singing at restaurants and weddings with different mariachi groups and the early beginnings of his career started to come about.</p>

                    <p class="body-text">
                        Fernandez began to be recognized locally when he participated in the radio show Amanecer Tapatio as well as appearing on the television show La Calandria musical at 21 years old. From there, his musical career began taking off thanks to the radio network XEX-AM which later led to his first contract with CBS Mexico. He began his career recording the albums “Soy de Abajo”, “Ni en Defensa Propia”, and “Palabra de Rey”; however, it wasn’t until his albums “La voz que estaba Esperando”, “El Rey”, “El hijo del pueblo”, and “Para recordar” where he saw millions of copies sold. His career continued to catch fire throughout the 1970s and 1980s as he gave multiple live concerts, went on tour, recorded more albums, and put out hits like one of his most famous songs--- Volver, Volver. In the 1990s, Fernandez saw himself at the peak of his career so much so that he was dubbed “the Mexican Sinatra”. Finally, in the 2000s and early 2010s, his career began to slow down due to his age, but he continued to receive recognitions, awards, and putting out albums that captivated the latin-american audience.

Vicente Jr. and Alejandro went on to follow the footsteps of their father as singers and made multiple appearances with “Chente” on stage. Fernandez went on to have 11 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. Unfortunately, Fernandez suffered many health conditions throughout his life including cancer on two occasions.

                        Vicente Fernandez died on December 12, 2021, at the age of 81 after a series of health complications. He had been placed in intensive care after a severe fall he had a couple of months prior and with a sudden attack of pneumonia, Fernandez’s health was in critical condition. A whole culture mourned his death--- from fans all the way to Presidents. The world was shocked and felt that an idol had been taken from them too soon. The artist’s body was transferred to Guadalajar where his family and many fans were already waiting for him to say their final goodbyes. He was finally taken to his ranch to be buried in a mausoleum.
